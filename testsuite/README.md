# Testsuite Folder Structure

A rough description of what kind of test is in each folder.

This is not by any means exact, and the subfolders serve more as
a way of breaking up the tests so there are not too many in
one folder.

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `f0`   | Tests for basic language constructs |
| `f1`   | Tests of compound/more advanced language constructs |
| `f2`   | Tests concerning data types |
| `f3`   | "Real World Code" Tests |
| `f4`   | Tests around structs, enums and global variables |
| `f5`   | Tests around IR transforms & passes |
| `f6`   | Miscellaneous regression tests
